   ![Attrition by gender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4849ba73-2da0-4222-9dec-aeb91d81c7aa)

   #### Key Insight:
    The male attrition count is 150(63.3%) while that of the female is 87(36.7%). Higher male attrition indicates a  potential issue woth the male employment retention. The male attrition rate is still high 
    because it accounts for over a third of the total attrition. This could be as a result of Lack of opportunities for growth and development, Inadequate compensation, Lack of work-Life balance.
   #### Recommendation:
     - Conduct interviews and surveys to understand reasons behind attrition.
     - Review feedbacks to know areas to improve on.
     - Ensure an inclusive workplace with equal opportunities.

   #### Key Insight:
   The R&D has the highest attrition of 133 which is over half of the total attrition. This indicates issues with job satisfaction or compensation. The sales department has 92 nattrition which is a bit high and 
   should also be reviewed as well while. The HR is low suggesting an effective retention startegies.

4. Attrition by Educational Field:

    ![Attrition by edu field](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c435655-83e3-45da-8d0b-d58de5ead0de)

   This analysis shows that the largest proportion of departing employees totaling 89 come from the Life Science  educational field. Following closely is the medical educational field with 63 counts of attrition 
   while the Human Resource has the lowest with 7 count of attrition.
   The high number of departure among those from Life Science  shows the need for focused attention and strategic  efforts to reduce attrition in this group. Conversly, the lower departure among the Human 
   Resources suggests there may be an effective retention factor at play. Understanding this trend provides the organization with insights to develop retention strategies.

5. Attrition by Marital Status:

    ![Attrtion by marital status](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7cdac35-2e62-4cdc-b6fc-1c5e85e41d94)
   
   The male has the highest number of attrition in the three category. In the single category, the male has 73 count of attrition, in the married category, the male also have the highest with 53 and in the 
   divorced category, the male still have the highest number of attrition which is 24. This can be as a result of the family and relationship issues, health or wellness concerns.
   The main reason for high rete of attrition in the male gender should be investigated and measures should be taken immediately.

7. Attrition by Age:

   ![Attrition count by Age](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bae7a97-5aa6-40a2-a5e7-a3c31760a06b)
   This visual shows that the highest number of employees leaving the organization is in the age group of 25 to 34 years old, with a total of 112 individual and among them are 69 males. The next age category is 
   35 to 44 years with 51 count of attrition. On the other hand, the age group of 55 and above has the fewest count of 11. Examining the attrition rate across the age groups, you will discover that the employees 
   within the age group of 25 to 34 displays a greater inclination to leave while individuals aged 55 and above demonstrate notably lower rates of departure. This emphasizes the need for precise retention 
   strategies designed to address the unique concerns and goals of younger employees. Implementing initiatives centered around career development,mentorship and work-life balance could particularly effective 
   within these age bracket.
